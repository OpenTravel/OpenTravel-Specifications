Examples:  BedType_Enum, Gender_Enum, 
--- Common – The common library houses objects that are used across multiple libraries. 
Examples:  AmountPercent, Company, Person

Within this library you will find the RFP operations for Create, Read, Update and Delete.
--- Product – The Product library houses objects that are specific to sellable products such as rooms in a hotel, seats on an airplane or seats on a train.
